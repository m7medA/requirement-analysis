# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves documenting, analyzing, and structuring the needs of a project before development begins. It ensures that the software meets business objectives, user expectations, and technical feasibility.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?  
Requirement Analysis plays a foundational role in SDLC by:  

- **Defining Clear Objectives** – Establishing what the software must achieve.  
- **Reducing Ambiguity** – Ensuring all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project scope.  
- **Preventing Scope Creep** – Avoiding unnecessary changes that could delay development.  
- **Providing a Blueprint for Development** – Helping developers, designers, and testers align their work.  
- **Enhancing Software Quality** – Ensuring the final product meets user needs and business goals.
